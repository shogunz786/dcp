## 🎓 Educational Examples

### Directed Graph Cycle Detection

```cpp
Graph graph(4, true);  // 4 vertices, directed
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(1, 2);
graph.addEdge(2, 3);
graph.addEdge(3, 1);   // Creates cycle: 1->2->3->1

CycleDetectionAlgorithms detector;
bool hasCycle = detector.hasDirectedCycleDFS(graph);
// Returns: true
```
